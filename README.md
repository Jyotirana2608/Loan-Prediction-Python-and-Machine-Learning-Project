# Loan-Prediction-Python-and-Machine-Learning-Project
Overview

The Loan Prediction Project is a machine learning-based system that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or rejected based on various features such as income, credit history, and loan amount. This project is useful for banks and financial institutions to automate the loan approval process.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains details about loan applicants, including:

Loan_ID: Unique identifier for the loan

Gender: Male/Female

Married: Applicant's marital status

Dependents: Number of dependents

Education: Applicant's education level

Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed

ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant

CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant

LoanAmount: Amount of loan applied for

Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan

Credit_History: Applicant's credit history

Property_Area: Urban/Semi-urban/Rural

Loan_Status: Target variable (Y/N)

Project Workflow

Data Collection: Acquire and preprocess loan data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and handle missing values.

Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical values.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models.

Model Training & Evaluation: Train models and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction & Deployment: Implement the best model and create a web interface for predictions.
